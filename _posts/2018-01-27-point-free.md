Back in September I announced that my colleague [Stephen Celis](http://www.stephencelis.com/) and I would be launching a new video series focused on functional programming and Swift, called [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co). Four months later, and a whole [server-side Swift web framework written from scratch](https://www.skilled.io/u/swiftsummit/server-side-swift-from-scratch), we are live!

The [first episode](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep1-functions) is up and available to everyone, and the [second episode](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep2-side-effects) is up for [subscribers](https://www.pointfree.co/pricing)!

### Open source

Also, all of the Swift code written for the backend, from middleware and routing to views and payments, is completely open sourced on our [GitHub organization](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco). We discovered quite a few amazing things along the way. For example, using the Xcode toolchain it is trivial to write screenshot tests on webpages.

Further, by pushing [side effects](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep2-side-effects) to the boundary of the application, we are able to run entire webpages directly in a playground. This made experimentation and iteration a breeze!
