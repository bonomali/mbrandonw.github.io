My name is Brandon Williams, and Iâ€™m currently working as a [contractor and consultant](/hire-me), but led iOS and Android development at [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) for 5.5 years. I did [math](https://github.com/mbrandonw/my-math-notes) for a very long time, including graduate school. Most of everything I write comes with the strange view on reality that mathematicians have.
