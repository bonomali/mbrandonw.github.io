## Finding Happiness in Functional Programming
**Oct 2016:** At the [2016 Functional Swift Conference](http://2016.funswiftconf.com) in Budapest I spoke about how embracing simple, pure functions above all other abstractions has enabled my colleagues and me to build a well-tested, well-understood [codebase](https://kickstarter.engineering/open-sourcing-our-android-and-ios-apps-6891be909fcd). I first covered the basics of pure functions and the ideas of identifying effects and separating them from your functions. I then described how these ideas allowed us better our testing suites, enabled us to replace simulators and storyboards with Swift playgrounds, and ultimately a better working relationship with engineers, designers and product managers.

## Lenses in Swift
**Dec 2015:** At the [2015 Functional Swift Conference](http://2015.funswiftconf.com) in Brooklyn I described the basics of lenses and how to implement them in Swift.

## Proof in Functions
**Feb 2015:** At the [Brooklyn Swift Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Brooklyn-Swift-Developers/events/220352273/) I described how we can use the Swift type system to prove simple mathematical theorems. This talk coveres most of everything I discussed in my post [“Proof in Functions”](http://www.fewbutripe.com/swift/math/2015/01/06/proof-in-functions.html).

## Functional Programming in a Playground
**Dec 2014:** At the [2014 Functional Swift Conference](http://2014.funswiftconf.com) in Brooklyn I used Swift playgrounds as a highly interactive way for exploring functional programming ideas. In particular, I developed the ideas of transducers and show how they lead to highly composable data transformations.
