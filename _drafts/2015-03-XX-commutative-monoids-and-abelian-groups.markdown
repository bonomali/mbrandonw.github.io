In a previous article we constructed the natural numbers from first principles, and at the end I posed an exercise of how to continue that work to construct all integers. Then, in a later article, we explored the idea of algebraic structure and protocols, and in particular defined a very important structure known as a monoid. In this article I will bridge those worlds by demonstrating a universal method to construct an abelian group from a commutative monoid. The term “universal” here is very precise, and by the end of this article we will have explored why it’s so important.
