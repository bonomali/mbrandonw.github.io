Last December I helped organize a single-day [conference](http://2014.funswiftconf.com) on exploring the ideas of functional programming using Appleâ€™s new language, Swift. The conference went amazingly well, mostly thanks to my co-organizer [Chris Eidhof](http://www.eidhof.nl). I gave 30 minute talk that on the surface probably seems like a discussion on [transducers](http://clojure.org/transducers), but really ir was a live-coding demo on how to think functionally with Swift. We got knee deep into some complex topics, but I had a blast.

Every talk from that [conference](http://2014.funswiftconf.com) is worth watch.
