Last December I helped organize a single-day [conference](http://2014.funswiftconf.com) on exploring the ideas of functional programming using Appleâ€™s new language, Swift. The conference went amazingly well, mostly thanks to my co-organizer [Chris Eidhof](http://www.eidhof.nl). Each talk is only 30 minutes and highly recommended.

I gave 30 minute talk that on the surface might seem like a discussion on [transducers](http://clojure.org/transducers), but really it was a live-coding session on how to think functionally with Swift. It was largely based on [some work](http://github.com/mbrandonw/learn-transducers-playground) of mine from November where I embedded an HTML tutorial inside a Swift playground, so that as you progressed through the article you could edit the code that was being demoed.
